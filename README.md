# graph

1.Nodes/vertex
2.Edge

Two types : Undirected Graph | Directed Graph(Also we can have bidirectional edges)


Cycles in a Graph:
A cycle is defined as any path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no other vertices visited during that path.

start from a node and end at that node.
It can have multiple cycles

Otherwise Acyclic;

PATH - > contains lots of nodes and each of them are reachable.(you cannot have node appear twice in a path)

DEGREE ON GRAPH -> Number of edges attached to a noded/vertex is called DOG for undirected graph.

TOTAL DEGREE OF GRAPH = Twice the number of edges

Total DOG = 2 * e


While in DIRECTED GRAPH:

Indegree = No. of incoming direction edges
Outdegree = No. of outcoming direction edges

Edge weights:
It can be assigned, if not we take as unit weights which is 1.
